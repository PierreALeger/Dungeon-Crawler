# Demo

This is a small portion of a team project that was delivered for a course in C++ during my second year of study.
The full source is in a private repository and is available on request (I would prefer not to publish it since I could get into trouble if someone decides to plagiarize it in the future).

The character class relies heavily on the item class. Only headers were included since I did not code the implementation myself.
The bulk of the back-end for the game are the Campaign, Character and Map .h/.cpp files.
